# THACoS

Thacos is a prototype designed within the [Twin Hubs](http://creativeflip.creativehubs.net/open-call-for-twin-hubs/) exchange programme.  
It's deveveloped by an international team from [On/Off](https://officineonoff.com/) (Parma, Italy) and [F O R](https://f-o-r.ro/) (Timi»ôoara, Romania).  
At its core Thacos is a sensor that collects environmental data and suggests responsible behaviors to people using shared workspaces.  
The whole project is based on a data-driven approach and it's meant to be replicable in an effort to help reduce the environmental impact of shared workspaces.
